# Exercise 3: Browser Compatibility

## Objective

Create a canvas application that handles browser compatibility issues and provides appropriate fallbacks.

## Requirements

1. Implement feature detection for:
   - Basic canvas support
   - Required canvas features (paths, text, gradients)
   - Touch support
2. Provide fallback content for unsupported features
3. Create a gradient-based drawing that works across browsers
4. Handle both mouse and touch events
5. Display browser capability information

## Starter Code

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <title>Canvas Exercise 3</title>
    <style>
      /* Add your styles here */
    </style>
  </head>
  <body>
    <!-- Add your canvas here -->
    <script>
      // Add your JavaScript here
    </script>
  </body>
</html>
```

## Tips

- Test feature detection before using features
- Provide meaningful fallback content
- Use pointer events where supported
- Consider mobile browser limitations
