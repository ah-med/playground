# Metal Component Library

## Overview

The Metal Component Library is a collection of reusable UI components designed for the Metal Music Player web application. It follows the shadcn/ui approach of open code and composition, implements Atomic Design methodology for systematic component organization, and uses Storybook for documentation and interactive testing.

## Core Principles

### 1. Open Code Approach (shadcn/ui)

- Components are provided as source code rather than a compiled library
- Full transparency and control over component implementation
- Easy customization and modification of components
- AI-ready code structure for better integration with LLMs

### 2. Atomic Design Methodology

Components will be organized into five distinct stages:

#### Atoms

- Basic building blocks (buttons, inputs, labels, icons)
- Cannot be broken down further without losing functionality
- Examples: MetalButton, MetalInput, MetalIcon

#### Molecules

- Simple combinations of atoms
- Form distinct functional units
- Examples: SearchBar (input + button), CardHeader (title + subtitle)

#### Organisms

- Complex UI components composed of molecules and atoms
- Form complete functional sections
- Examples: MusicCard, PlaylistGrid, NavigationBar

#### Templates

- Page layouts without real content
- Content structure skeletons
- Examples: MainLayout, SidebarLayout, GridLayout

#### Pages

- Specific instances of templates with real content
- Final UI implementation
- Examples: HomePage, LibraryPage, ProfilePage

### 3. Storybook Integration

- Interactive documentation for all components
- Visual testing environment
- Component playground
- Accessibility testing
- Responsive design testing
- Theme switching demonstration

## Implementation Steps

### Phase 1: Setup and Foundation

1. Initialize project structure

   - Set up component library directory
   - Configure build tools
   - Set up Storybook
   - Configure theme system

2. Create base styles
   - Define CSS variables
   - Set up typography system
   - Create color palette
   - Define spacing system

### Phase 2: Atomic Components

1. Implement Atoms

   - Basic form elements
   - Buttons and icons
   - Typography elements
   - Basic layout elements

2. Create Molecules
   - Form combinations
   - Card components
   - Navigation elements
   - Search components

### Phase 3: Complex Components

1. Build Organisms

   - Music player controls
   - Playlist components
   - Navigation systems
   - Content grids

2. Develop Templates
   - Page layouts
   - Content structures
   - Grid systems
   - Responsive patterns

### Phase 4: Documentation and Testing

1. Storybook Implementation

   - Component documentation
   - Interactive examples
   - Usage guidelines
   - Accessibility testing

2. Testing and Quality Assurance
   - Visual regression testing
   - Responsive design testing
   - Accessibility compliance
   - Cross-browser testing

### Phase 5: Integration and Deployment

1. Integration with Main Application

   - Component import system
   - Theme integration
   - Style override system
   - Version control

2. Deployment and Maintenance
   - Documentation deployment
   - Version management
   - Update system
   - Contribution guidelines

## Technical Requirements

### Development Environment

- Node.js and npm/yarn
- Storybook
- CSS preprocessor (SASS/SCSS)
- TypeScript support
- Git for version control

### Component Requirements

- Modular and reusable
- Fully responsive
- Accessible (WCAG 2.1 compliance)
- Themeable
- Well-documented
- Tested across browsers

### Documentation Requirements

- Component API documentation
- Usage examples
- Props documentation
- Theme customization guide
- Accessibility guidelines
- Responsive design guidelines

## Success Criteria

1. All components from the music player application are successfully recreated
2. Components follow Atomic Design methodology
3. Components are fully documented in Storybook
4. Components are accessible and responsive
5. Components are easily customizable
6. Components maintain consistent styling
7. Components are performant and optimized
8. Documentation is comprehensive and clear

## Timeline

- Phase 1: 1 week
- Phase 2: 2 weeks
- Phase 3: 2 weeks
- Phase 4: 1 week
- Phase 5: 1 week

Total estimated time: 7 weeks

## Next Steps

1. Set up project structure
2. Configure development environment
3. Create initial atomic components
4. Begin Storybook integration
